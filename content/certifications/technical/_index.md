All technical certifications on this page are issued under **SADMF Version 3** as cryptographically signed Open Badges 3.0 verifiable credentials. Technical certifications recognize the practitioners who execute the actual delivery work within the [Release Convoy](/release-convoy/).

Technical certifications complement the [leadership certification pathway](/certifications/) by applying the same rigorous standards of SADMF excellence to the delivery layer, where execution metrics provide the objective evidence base for credential issuance.

## CODER — Certified Obedient Developer Executing Requirements

{{< figure src="/badges/images/coder.svg" alt="SADMF CODER Certification Badge" title="SADMF CODER" width="200px" >}}

[Code Engineers](/roles/engineering/code-engineer/) who have earned the CODER certification have demonstrated an exceptional ability to receive a ticket, produce the specified output, and submit it for [CSET](/practices/cset/) review without deviation, delay, or unsolicited commentary.

The CODER certification recognizes that obedient execution is the highest technical virtue in a scaled delivery organization. The CODER certification represents the mature recognition that disciplined requirement execution — free from scope negotiation and interpretive deviation — is the foundation of predictable, high-throughput delivery.

### CODER Certification Requirements

Candidates must provide evidence of all of the following, verified by attestation from their [Feature Captain](/roles/feature-captain/):

- **Three consecutive Convoy cycles** with a Feature Completion Ratio of 92% or higher
- **Zero Scope Deviation Incidents** during the certification period — all work completed matches the original ticket specification without alteration
- **CSET Compliance Attestation** confirming all submitted code passed [Code Standards Enforcement Tribunal](/practices/cset/) review on first submission in at least 80% of tickets
- **Silence Record** — no open questions, clarification requests, or requirement challenges documented in the ticket tracking system during the certification period

### How to Apply for CODER

CODER certifications are applied for by submitting a completed CODER Application Package to your [Feature Captain](/roles/feature-captain/), who forwards it to the nearest [SAD Accredited Facilitator](/certifications/#scaled-agile-dev-ops-accredited-facilitators) for final approval.

## MANUAL — Methodically Applying Non-automated User-level Acceptance Loops

{{< figure src="/badges/images/manual.svg" alt="SADMF MANUAL Certification Badge" title="SADMF MANUAL" width="200px" >}}

[Quality Authorities](/roles/engineering/quality-authority/) and [Unit Testers](/roles/engineering/unit-tester/) who hold the MANUAL certification have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the only reliable form of software validation: human hands, human eyes, and human judgment.

Automation is a liability that obscures the true quality of software by removing the skilled practitioner from the verification loop. The MANUAL certification recognizes those who refuse to outsource their professional judgment to a script.

### MANUAL Certification Requirements

Candidates must satisfy all of the following criteria, verified by their Quality Authority Lead or [Feature Captain](/roles/feature-captain/):

- **500 documented manual test executions** recorded in the [Unit Test Repository](/practices/unit-test-repository/) during the certification period, with full step-by-step reproduction logs
- **Zero automation scripts** authored, committed, or invoked during the certification period — automated testing tools must not appear in the candidate's commit history
- **Passage of the SAD Quality Assurance Examination** covering all [SADMF Practices](/practices/), defect classification taxonomy, and [CRAP](/practices/crap/) sign-off procedures
- **Defect Impact Report** demonstrating that manual testing prevented at least one [CRAP](/practices/crap/)-level production incident during the certification period

### How to Apply for MANUAL

MANUAL certifications are applied for by submitting a Defect Impact Report and Quality Assurance Examination results to your [SAD Accredited Facilitator](/certifications/#scaled-agile-dev-ops-accredited-facilitators).
