Planning Ceremonies are the foundational ceremonies of the DevOps Release Convoy&trade; lifecycle. They occur before active development begins and establish the commitments, schedules, task breakdowns, and team compositions that the rest of the convoy depends upon.

These ceremonies must be completed in strict sequence. Attempting to begin development without completing all Planning Ceremonies introduces unacceptable uncertainty into the delivery timeline and undermines the coordination achievements of [Convoy Alignment](/release-convoy/planning/ceremonies/convoy-alignment/).

## Planning Ceremony Sequence

1. **[Captains' Meeting](/release-convoy/planning/ceremonies/captains-meeting/)** — Schedules the date of the planning event. Must be completed before Convoy Alignment can be announced.
2. **[Convoy Alignment](/release-convoy/planning/ceremonies/convoy-alignment/)** — The foundational 5-day event where all teams commit to the next eight quarters of delivery.
3. **[Provisioning](/release-convoy/planning/ceremonies/provisioning/)** — Decomposes feature commitments into granular task lists by the Feature Captains.
4. **[Press Gang](/release-convoy/planning/ceremonies/press-gang/)** — Assembles feature teams by drafting Code Engineers from the shared coding pool.
