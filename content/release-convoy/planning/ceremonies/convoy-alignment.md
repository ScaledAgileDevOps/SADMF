Convoy Alignment is the cornerstone planning ceremony of the DevOps Release Convoy, held every six weeks to establish priorities, commitments, and feature sequencing for the next eight quarters. This two-year planning horizon ensures that the organization is never caught off guard by the future and that every team has a clear, unchanging roadmap to follow. Features are prioritized using the [Weighted Shortest Voyage First (WSVF)](/release-convoy/wsvf/) framework and mapped onto the delivery timeline using [Nautical Charts](/release-convoy/nautical-charts/), giving leadership full visibility into what will be delivered, by whom, and when, well before anyone has examined whether it is technically feasible.

The full ceremony agenda, including day-by-day breakdowns, required attendees, and expected outputs, is documented on the [Convoy Alignment Agenda](/release-convoy/agenda/) page. All participants are strongly encouraged to review the agenda in advance, as the five days are fully scheduled and there is no time allocated for questions about the process itself.
