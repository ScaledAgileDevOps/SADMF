Between convoys, teams are granted Shore Leave: a brief period where [Code Engineers](/roles/code-engineer/) are free to explore new technologies, reduce technical debt, and pursue innovative ideas. This ensures the organization maintains a culture of continuous learning and creativity.

## Approved Shore Leave Activities

To ensure Shore Leave time is used productively, the [Admiral's Transformation Office](/roles/admirals-transformation-office/) maintains an approved activity list. Activities not on this list require a Shore Leave Exemption Request (SLER) approved by the [Commodore](/roles/commodore/).

Approved activities include:

- Completing mandatory compliance training modules
- Updating personal [SADMF Maturity Score](/metrics/sadmf-maturity-score/) assessments
- Preparing presentation materials for the next [Convoy Alignment](/release-convoy/agenda/)
- Filing overdue [Post-Standup Standup Review](/release-convoy/ceremonies/post-standup-standup-review/) reports
- Studying for [SAD certification](/certifications/) renewal exams
- Attending cross-functional awareness workshops organized by the [DOUCHE](/roles/devops-usage-and-compliance-head-engineer/)

## Innovation Proposals

[Code Engineers](/roles/code-engineer/) who wish to pursue innovative ideas during Shore Leave must submit an Innovation Proposal Package (IPP) containing:

- A business case with projected ROI over 8 quarters
- Architectural approval from the [EARB](/roles/enterprise-architecture-review-board/)
- A risk assessment reviewed by the [CRAP](/roles/change-rejection-or-acceptance-party/)
- Sign-off from at least three [Feature Captains](/roles/feature-captain/) confirming the innovation will not impact their features
- A rollback plan in case the innovation succeeds and causes organizational disruption

Innovation Proposals are reviewed on a quarterly cadence. Approved proposals may be scheduled for implementation in a future convoy, subject to [WSVF](/release-convoy/wsvf/) prioritization.

## Shore Leave Duration

Shore Leave is nominally one week between convoy cycles. However, any overdue [Convoy Manifest](/release-convoy/manifest/) documentation, incomplete status reports, or pending [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/) follow-up actions must be completed first. In practice, most teams begin their next [Convoy Alignment](/release-convoy/agenda/) preparation on Shore Leave day two.
