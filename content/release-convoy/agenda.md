## Attendance

All teams should assemble in the Convoy Alignment room for this multi-day celebration of detailed planning. It is important that the alignment happens in person and that everyone travels to a remote location to eliminate distractions from less important things such as family or pets.

## Establish a Focused Environment

We need to maximize our planning time. We only have 5 days to plan the quarter, after all. Schedule what is ideally 9 hours of work each day. Because we have eliminated any distractions not related to work, we can easily extend the daily meetings if we don't meet each day's planning goals. Plan the planning! If we cannot meet our commitments, we cannot go fast.

Feel comfortable that since there are no extra-work distractions, the teams will all be able to provide their utmost focus and attention to the work at hand, even if it gets extended by a few hours due to the executive management team's desire to exceed expectations.

Breaks and lunch can eat into our schedule. Additionally, people enjoy a change in diet. Take a collection at the beginning of each day and order sandwiches. Not only will this eliminate the need to stop for lunch, but it will also result in the team-building results of a shared meal!

## Management Address

Day 1 begins with the Management Address, where senior leadership presents the strategic vision for the upcoming convoy cycle. The Admiral or [Commodore](/roles/#commodore-c) will outline the top priorities, which will bear no resemblance to the priorities communicated at the previous Convoy Alignment. This is expected. Strategic agility means being able to pivot the entire organization's direction every 6 weeks while maintaining the 8-quarter commitment plan from the previous alignment.

[Code Engineers](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) are encouraged to take notes, though the strategic direction will be further clarified through a series of follow-up emails over the next 3 weeks. Questions during the Management Address should be limited to expressions of enthusiasm.

## Dependency Negotiation Theater

On Days 2 through 4, teams engage in Dependency Negotiation Theater. Each [Feature Captain](/roles/#feature-captain-fc) identifies every team their feature depends on and negotiates delivery commitments with those teams' Feature Captains. These negotiations are conducted in a large room with all teams present so that the [Commodore](/roles/#commodore-c) can observe which teams are being collaborative and which are "creating blockers."

Dependencies are recorded on the [Nautical Chart](/release-convoy/nautical-charts/) using colored string. The density of string on the chart is a leading indicator of alignment maturity. Charts with minimal string suggest teams are not thinking broadly enough about their impact on others.

Teams that cannot resolve dependency conflicts during the negotiation window may escalate to the [Commodore](/roles/#commodore-c), who will resolve the dispute by assigning the dependency to whichever team has the most [Code Engineers](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) currently in the coding pool.

## Wrapping Up Alignment

On the last hour of the last day, while all of the alignment is fresh in our minds, hold a "Fist of Five" confidence vote on our ability to deliver the next 8 quarters' worth of work. We must all be very confident, so make sure everyone is aware that anything less than a score of 4 will result in additional planning until we get to the minimum confidence level. If there is not a unanimous vote of 4 or better, take another collection for sandwiches and continue until everyone is confident.

All stakeholders must be included in the vote. Alignment requires unanimity. Letting the developers see the votes of their managers and vice-versa will ensure that accountability is maintained. In the event of disparity between the developers and managers, ensure that the managers' votes receive preference since they can influence the developers to work harder.

### Confidence Vote Escalation Protocol

If the initial Fist of Five vote does not achieve unanimity at 4 or above, the following escalation protocol is activated:

1. **Round 2**: The [Commodore](/roles/#commodore-c) asks anyone who voted below 4 to explain their concerns publicly. Their concerns are recorded on the [Nautical Chart](/release-convoy/nautical-charts/) as risks.
2. **Round 3**: The concerns are "addressed" by the Commodore verbally confirming that the risks are acknowledged. A new vote is taken.
3. **Round 4**: If unanimity has still not been achieved, the [Commodore](/roles/#commodore-c) reminds the room that the hotel conference room is booked through the weekend and that additional sandwich collections will be taken.
4. **Round 5**: Unanimity is achieved.
