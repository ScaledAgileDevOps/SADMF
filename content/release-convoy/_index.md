Keeping track of frequent releases by independent teams is just too much cognitive load. We need to *[Work in Small Batches.](/principles/work-in-small-batches/)* The DevOps Release Convoy&trade; (DORC) simplifies things. Why burden ourselves tracking 5 or 10 releases per quarter if we can use 1 easily managed DORC&trade;?

## Why Convoys?

Other frameworks have tried to coordinate things with more linear transportation metaphors. However, they are constrained to a single direction. With DORCs&trade; we have more options. We can turn left or right or even make a U-turn!

## How the Convoy Works

The DevOps Release Convoy&trade; is a comprehensive delivery system with these key components:

1. **[Convoy Alignment](/release-convoy/agenda/)** begins each cycle with a 5-day, in-person planning session where all teams commit to the next 8 quarters of features. Features are prioritized using [WSVF](/release-convoy/wsvf/) scoring and visualized on [Nautical Charts](/release-convoy/nautical-charts/).

2. **[Convoy Ceremonies](/release-convoy/ceremonies/)** provide the daily and weekly rituals needed to maintain oversight throughout the cycle. From the [Press Gang](/release-convoy/ceremonies/press-gang/) that assembles Feature Teams to the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/) that ensures accountability, every ceremony serves a critical governance function.

3. **[Convoy Manifest](/release-convoy/manifest/)** documents the critical paperwork required for every DORC&trade;. No convoy sails without proper documentation.

4. **[Delivering Change](/release-convoy/deploy/)** describes the READY release process and the Convoy Steering Committee that ensures all changes are approved at the highest levels before the fleet sets sail.

5. **[Fleet Inspection](/release-convoy/fleet-inspection/)** provides the formal review where completed features are presented to leadership through carefully prepared slide decks. No live demonstrations are permitted.

6. **[Shore Leave](/release-convoy/shore-leave/)** is the structured innovation period between convoy cycles where [Code Engineers](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) may pursue approved activities from the pre-authorized list.

7. **[The Armada](/release-convoy/armada/)** coordinates multiple convoys when the enterprise has scaled beyond what a single DORC&trade; can manage. An Admiral commands the fleet of fleets.

## Key Roles in the Convoy

The Convoy depends on clearly defined [Roles](/roles/) to function. The [Commodore](/roles/#commodore-c) commands the Convoy. [Feature Captains](/roles/#feature-captain-fc) track individual features. [Code Engineers](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) implement requirements quickly and quietly. See [Roles](/roles/) for the complete chain of command.
