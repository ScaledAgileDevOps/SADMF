The DevOps Release Convoy&trade; depends on a carefully orchestrated set of ceremonies to maintain alignment, accountability, and the appropriate level of oversight. Each ceremony serves a critical function in the convoy lifecycle, and skipping any of them would introduce unacceptable risk to the delivery process.

## The Ceremony Lifecycle

Ceremonies follow the natural rhythm of each convoy cycle:

1. **Plan** -- [Convoy Alignment](/release-convoy/agenda/) establishes commitments, [Provisioning](/release-convoy/ceremonies/provisioning/) decomposes them into tasks, and the [Press Gang](/release-convoy/ceremonies/press-gang/) assembles the teams.
2. **Build** -- [Code Engineers](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) implement features through [Coding](/release-convoy/ceremonies/coding/), followed by [Code Inspection](/release-convoy/ceremonies/code-inspection/) and [Testing](/release-convoy/ceremonies/testing/).
3. **Communicate** -- The [Scrum of Scrum of Scrums](/release-convoy/ceremonies/scrum-of-scrum-of-scrums/) and its companion ceremonies keep information flowing through the proper channels.
4. **Review** -- [Fleet Inspection](/release-convoy/fleet-inspection/) validates completed features, and [Manifest Approval](/release-convoy/ceremonies/manifest-approval/) authorizes the fleet to sail.
5. **Reflect** -- The [Harbor Review](/release-convoy/ceremonies/harbor-review/) generates action items, and [Shore Leave](/release-convoy/shore-leave/) provides a brief recovery before the cycle begins again.

Throughout the cycle, the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/) and [Rota Fortunae](/release-convoy/ceremonies/rota-fortunae/) maintain organizational health through accountability and periodic restructuring.
