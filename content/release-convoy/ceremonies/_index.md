The DevOps Release Convoy&trade; depends on a carefully orchestrated set of ceremonies to maintain alignment, accountability, and the appropriate level of oversight. Each ceremony serves a critical function in the convoy lifecycle, and skipping any of them would introduce unacceptable risk to the delivery process.

## The Ceremony Lifecycle

Ceremonies follow the natural rhythm of each convoy cycle:

1. **Plan** -- The [Captains' Meeting](/release-convoy/ceremonies/captains-meeting/) schedules the planning event, [Convoy Alignment](/release-convoy/agenda/) establishes commitments, [Provisioning](/release-convoy/ceremonies/provisioning/) decomposes them into tasks, and the [Press Gang](/release-convoy/ceremonies/press-gang/) assembles the teams.
2. **Build** -- [Code Engineers](/roles/code-engineer/) implement features through [Coding](/release-convoy/ceremonies/coding/), followed by [Code Inspection](/release-convoy/ceremonies/code-inspection/), [System Integration Testing](/release-convoy/ceremonies/system-integration-testing/), and [Testing](/release-convoy/ceremonies/testing/).
3. **Communicate** -- The [Scrum of Scrum of Scrums](/release-convoy/ceremonies/scrum-of-scrum-of-scrums/), the [Post-Standup Standup](/release-convoy/ceremonies/post-standup-standup/), and the [Post-Standup Standup Review](/release-convoy/ceremonies/post-standup-standup-review/) keep information flowing through the proper channels.
4. **Review** -- [Fleet Inspection](/release-convoy/fleet-inspection/) validates completed features, and [Manifest Approval](/release-convoy/ceremonies/manifest-approval/) authorizes the fleet to sail.
5. **Reflect** -- [Dry Dock](/release-convoy/ceremonies/dry-dock/) addresses accumulated defects, the [Harbor Review](/release-convoy/ceremonies/harbor-review/) generates action items, and [Shore Leave](/release-convoy/shore-leave/) provides a brief recovery before the cycle begins again.

Throughout the cycle, the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/) and [Rota Fortunae](/release-convoy/ceremonies/rota-fortunae/) maintain organizational health through accountability and periodic restructuring. The [Change Adjudication Convening](/release-convoy/ceremonies/change-adjudication-convening/) operates on a fixed biweekly cadence, independent of Convoy phase, serving as the standing gate through which all changes must pass before inclusion in any fleet.
