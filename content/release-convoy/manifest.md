A Convoy doesn't navigate by dead reckoning. We require proper documentation to keep from leaving any Release Captain behind!

## Manifest Contents

Every DORC&trade; must include a complete manifest documenting the following before the [Convoy Steering Committee](/release-convoy/deploy/#convoy-steering-committee-csc) will permit it to sail:

- Feature inventory with estimated and actual story points
- [Feature Captain](/roles/feature-captain/) assignments and sign-off
- [CSET](/roles/code-standards-enforcement-team/) code review completion certificates
- [EARB](/roles/enterprise-architecture-review-board/) naming compliance attestation
- [Quality Authority](/roles/quality-authority/) test certification reports
- [DIAT](/roles/development-integrity-assurance-team/) integrity validation sign-off
- [Commodore's](/roles/commodore/) final approval stamp

## Priority Change Request

A Priority Change Request must be created and approved during the [Captain's Mast](/release-convoy/ceremonies/captains-mast/) before changing the priority of any feature. This request must contain the following critical information:

- Feature name
- [Feature Captain's](/roles/feature-captain/) name
- Priority ID
- New proposed Priority ID
- [Feature Team](/roles/feature-team/) size
- [CSET](/roles/code-standards-enforcement-team/) approvals
- [EARB](/roles/enterprise-architecture-review-board/) approvals
- Approvals from all [Feature Captains](/roles/feature-captain/) in the Convoy
- [Commodore's](/roles/commodore/) approval
