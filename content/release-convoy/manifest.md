A Convoy doesn't navigate by dead reckoning. We require proper documentation to keep from leaving any Release Captain behind!

## Manifest Contents

Every DORC&trade; must include a complete manifest documenting the following before the [Convoy Steering Committee](/release-convoy/deploy/#convoy-steering-committee-csc) will permit it to sail:

- Feature inventory with estimated and actual story points
- [Feature Captain](/roles/#feature-captain-fc) assignments and sign-off
- [CSET](/roles/#code-standards-enforcement-team-cset) code review completion certificates
- [EARB](/roles/#enterprise-architecture-review-board-earb) naming compliance attestation
- [Quality Authority](/roles/#quality-authority-qa) test certification reports
- [DIAT](/roles/#development-integrity-assurance-team-diat) integrity validation sign-off
- [Commodore's](/roles/#commodore-c) final approval stamp

## Priority Change Request

A Priority Change Request must be created and approved during the [Captain's Mast](/release-convoy/ceremonies/captains-mast/) before changing the priority of any feature. This request must contain the following critical information:

- Feature name
- [Feature Captain's](/roles/#feature-captain-fc) name
- Priority ID
- New proposed Priority ID
- [Feature Team](/roles/#feature-team-ft) size
- [CSET](/roles/#code-standards-enforcement-team-cset) approvals
- [EARB](/roles/#enterprise-architecture-review-board-earb) approvals
- Approvals from all [Feature Captains](/roles/#feature-captain-fc) in the Convoy
- [Commodore's](/roles/#commodore-c) approval
