Workforce Analytics & Reporting (WAR) is the [PeopleWare HRaaS](/peopleware/) module that transforms raw workforce data into the executive-ready visualizations, rankings, and reports that leadership needs to manage human capital with the same precision they apply to financial capital. WAR consumes data from every other PeopleWare module -- the [Integrated Performance Profile (IPP)](/peopleware/integrated-performance-profile/), the [Automated Corrective Action Engine (ACAE)](/peopleware/automated-corrective-action-engine/), the [Psychological Safety Dashboard (PSD)](/peopleware/psychological-safety-dashboard/), [Certification & Compliance Tracking (CCT)](/peopleware/certification-compliance-tracking/), and [AI-Powered Talent Optimization (AIPTO)](/peopleware/ai-powered-talent-optimization/) -- and produces the Fleet Workforce Intelligence Report (FWIR), a comprehensive analytics package that the [Admiral's Transformation Office](/roles/admirals-transformation-office/) reviews weekly and presents to the board of directors quarterly. The FWIR is the single source of truth for all questions about the workforce: who is performing, who is not, who is at risk of leaving, who should be encouraged to leave, and how the organization's human resources compare to industry benchmarks that WAR generates internally based on its own data.

## Continuous Stack Ranking

The cornerstone of WAR is the Continuous Stack Ranking Engine (CSRE), which maintains a real-time, organization-wide ranking of every individual based on their Employee Value Index (EVI) from the IPP. The CSRE does not rank employees within their team or department -- it ranks every employee against every other employee in the entire organization, regardless of role, function, or tenure. A first-week [Code Engineer](/roles/code-engineer/) is ranked alongside a 20-year veteran [Commodore](/roles/commodore/), because the EVI normalizes performance across roles using the Role-Adjusted Performance Coefficient (RAPC), which the [Admiral's Transformation Office](/roles/admirals-transformation-office/) calibrates annually. The stack ranking is updated continuously as new data flows through the IPP, meaning an employee's rank can change multiple times per day. This continuous ranking eliminates the annual performance review cycle entirely -- there is no need to schedule a formal review when the employee's exact position relative to every colleague is available in real time on the WAR dashboard.

## Mandatory Distribution Curve

WAR enforces the Mandatory Distribution Curve (MDC), which requires that the workforce conforms to a predetermined performance distribution regardless of actual performance levels. These percentages are fixed and non-negotiable:

| Tier | Allocation | Label |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | 10% | Exceptional |
| 2 | 20% | Exceeds Expectations |
| 3 | 40% | Meets Expectations |
| 4 | 20% | Developing |
| 5 | 10% | Below Expectations |

If every single employee in the organization performs superbly, 10% of them are still classified as "Below Expectations," because the MDC measures relative position, not absolute achievement. This is not a flaw -- it is the mechanism that drives [Continuous Learning](/principles/continuous-learning/). An employee classified as "Below Expectations" is not necessarily performing poorly in any objective sense; they are simply performing less impressively than 90% of their colleagues. This relative pressure ensures that no one ever becomes complacent, because no matter how well you perform, someone is always performing better, and the curve will always place someone at the bottom.

## Workforce Refresh Rate

The MDC's bottom 10% feeds directly into WAR's most strategically important metric: the Workforce Refresh Rate (WRR). The WRR measures the percentage of the workforce that is replaced within a given time period, and WAR treats a healthy WRR as a sign of organizational vitality. A WRR of zero would indicate stagnation -- an organization where no one leaves, no one is asked to leave, and no new perspectives enter. The [Admiral's Transformation Office](/roles/admirals-transformation-office/) has established a target WRR of 12-18% annually, which WAR monitors and reports against. When the WRR falls below the target range, WAR generates a Workforce Stagnation Alert (WSA) recommending that the [ACAE](/peopleware/automated-corrective-action-engine/) lower its Dynamic Baseline Threshold to increase the volume of corrective actions. When the WRR exceeds the target range, WAR generates a Workforce Instability Alert (WIA) recommending that retention interventions be increased through the [AIPTO](/peopleware/ai-powered-talent-optimization/) module. The WRR is presented to the board alongside traditional metrics like revenue and customer satisfaction, positioning workforce turnover not as a problem to be minimized but as a lever to be optimized.

## Reporting Suite

WAR's reporting suite extends beyond individual rankings to provide aggregate workforce intelligence that supports strategic decision-making:

- **Talent Distribution Heat Map (TDHM)** -- visualizes certification density, EVI concentration, and attrition probability across organizational units, enabling the [Commodore](/roles/commodore/) to identify which [Systems of Authority](/roles/system-of-authority/) and [Systems of Service](/roles/system-of-service/) are most and least aligned with SADMF's performance expectations.
- **Ceremony Engagement Correlation Matrix (CECM)** -- analyzes the relationship between [ceremony](/release-convoy/) attendance and individual performance, providing data that invariably confirms that employees who attend more ceremonies perform better -- though whether this is because ceremonies improve performance or because compliant employees are rated higher is a question WAR does not attempt to answer, because correlation is sufficient for management action.

The [Lean Management](/principles/lean-management/) principle teaches that waste should be eliminated, and WAR provides the data to identify the most wasteful resource of all: an underperforming employee occupying a headcount that could be filled by someone with a higher projected EVI. WAR makes the case for replacement with the same dispassionate clarity that a financial model makes the case for divesting an underperforming asset.
