PeopleWare is the Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework's enterprise Human Resources as a Service (HRaaS) platform. Traditional HR departments rely on subjective human judgment to make personnel decisions -- managers form opinions, peers share impressions, and employees describe their own performance in self-assessments that are, by definition, biased. PeopleWare eliminates this subjectivity entirely by consuming the rich, quantitative data that SADMF already produces and transforming it into automated, defensible, and instantaneous HR actions. Every [metric](/metrics/), every [ceremony](/release-convoy/) outcome, every [assessment](/practices/devops-process-excellence-assessment/) score feeds directly into PeopleWare, creating a closed-loop system where performance is measured, judged, and acted upon without any human being needing to have an uncomfortable conversation.

The platform was designed from the ground up to serve organizations that have embraced SADMF and recognized that if the framework can manage software delivery at scale, it can certainly manage people at scale. After all, people are simpler than distributed systems. They have fewer dependencies, more predictable failure modes, and they respond to incentives in ways that are well-documented in management literature. PeopleWare simply applies the same rigor to workforce management that SADMF applies to everything else: measure everything, automate decisions, and treat consistency as the highest form of fairness.

## PeopleWare Capabilities

1. **[Integrated Performance Profile (IPP)](/peopleware/integrated-performance-profile/)** -- A comprehensive, permanent record aggregating every metric, assessment, and ceremony outcome for each individual across their entire SADMF tenure.

2. **[Automated Corrective Action Engine (ACAE)](/peopleware/automated-corrective-action-engine/)** -- Threshold-triggered warnings, performance improvement plans, and separation actions executed without managerial involvement.

3. **[Psychological Safety Dashboard (PSD)](/peopleware/psychological-safety-dashboard/)** -- Real-time monitoring of workforce sentiment and behavioral compliance, ensuring psychological safety through continuous observation.

4. **[Certification & Compliance Tracking (CCT)](/peopleware/certification-compliance-tracking/)** -- Automated tracking, reminders, and escalation for all SAD certification requirements and framework compliance obligations.

5. **[AI-Powered Talent Optimization (AIPTO)](/peopleware/ai-powered-talent-optimization/)** -- Machine learning models trained on SADMF metrics to predict attrition, identify flight risks, and optimize workforce composition.

6. **[Workforce Analytics & Reporting (WAR)](/peopleware/workforce-analytics-reporting/)** -- Stack-ranked performance dashboards, forced-distribution analytics, and executive-ready workforce health visualizations.

PeopleWare integrates seamlessly with SADMF by consuming data from the [DevOps Process Excellence Assessment](/practices/devops-process-excellence-assessment/), individual [Defects per Code Engineer](/metrics/defects-per-code-engineer/) tracking, [Lines of Code per Code Engineer](/metrics/lines-of-code-per-code-engineer/) output, [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/) outcomes, [Conflict Arbitration](/practices/conflict-arbitration/) verdicts, and [SADMF Maturity Score](/metrics/sadmf-maturity-score/) assessments. This ensures that HR decisions are fully data-driven and aligned with the framework. With PeopleWare, it has never been easier to HRaaS.
