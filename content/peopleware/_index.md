Introducing PeopleWare!
{{% /alert %}}

PeopleWare is an amazing new product from Scaled Agile DevOps that makes Human Resources easy to manage! Using our
exclusive individualized performance metrics and AI review process, PeopleWare enables management to maximize [productivity](/metrics)
and [psychological safety](/principles/#psychological-safety) simultaneously!

PeopleWare integrates seamlessly with SADMF by consuming data from the [DevOps Process Excellence Assessment](/practices/#devops-process-excellence-assessment), individual [Defects per Code Engineer](/metrics/#defects-per-code-engineer) tracking, and [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/) outcomes.
