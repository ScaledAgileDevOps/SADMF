Certification & Compliance Tracking (CCT) is the [PeopleWare HRaaS](/peopleware/) module that automates the monitoring, enforcement, and escalation of all SAD [certification](/certifications/) requirements across the organization. The [SADMF Adoption Rate](/metrics/sadmf-adoption-rate/) is one of the most visible metrics reported to the board of directors, and CCT ensures that this number only moves in one direction: up. Every employee's certification status is tracked in real time through the Certification Lifecycle Management System (CLMS), which monitors certification acquisition dates, expiration timelines, renewal windows, and the precise number of days until each individual's credentials lapse. When a certification is approaching expiration, CCT initiates the Automated Renewal Escalation Sequence (ARES), a multi-stage reminder and enforcement process that treats lapsed certification with the same urgency that a hospital treats a flatlined patient.

The ARES operates on a five-tier escalation model. Tier 1 begins 60 days before certification expiration with a friendly Certification Renewal Awareness Message (CRAM), a cheerful notification reminding the employee that their SAD certification is a valuable professional asset and encouraging them to register for a renewal workshop. Tier 2 activates at 30 days with a Certification Urgency Notification (CUN), which copies the employee's [System of Authority](/roles/system-of-authority/) lead and notes that the employee's [SADMF Adoption Rate](/metrics/sadmf-adoption-rate/) contribution is at risk. Tier 3 activates at 14 days with a Compliance Deficiency Alert (CDA), which adds the [DevOps Usage and Compliance Head Engineer (DOUCHE)](/roles/devops-usage-and-compliance-head-engineer/) to the notification chain and places a Certification Risk Flag (CRF) on the employee's [Integrated Performance Profile (IPP)](/peopleware/integrated-performance-profile/). Tier 4 activates on the day of expiration with a Certification Lapse Incident Report (CLIR), which automatically reduces the employee's [SADMF Maturity Score](/metrics/sadmf-maturity-score/) by one full tier and generates a finding in their next [DevOps Process Excellence Assessment](/practices/devops-process-excellence-assessment/). Tier 5 activates seven days after lapse with a Sustained Non-Compliance Escalation (SNCE), which routes the case to the [Automated Corrective Action Engine (ACAE)](/peopleware/automated-corrective-action-engine/) for inclusion in the Graduated Response Protocol.

The CCT module tracks all four certification levels defined in the SADMF certification program: SAD Practitioner, SAD Professional, SAD Master, and SAD Fellow. Each level has its own renewal cycle, with higher levels requiring more frequent renewal to ensure that the organization's most certified individuals maintain their edge. The SAD Practitioner certification renews every 12 months. SAD Professional renews every 8 months. SAD Master renews every 6 months. And SAD Fellow renews every 4 months, reflecting the Fellow's commitment to living the framework at the highest level. The [DEPRESSED](/practices/depressed/) team certification has its own renewal cycle of 8 weeks, as specified in the certification documentation, and CCT tracks this separately through the Team Certification Compliance Module (TCCM). Teams that allow their DEPRESSED certification to lapse lose their designation as a certified [Feature Team](/roles/feature-team/) and must reserve an entire sprint to re-certify, during which they produce no deliverable output -- a consequence that the [Commodore](/roles/commodore/) communicates as "investing in excellence."

CCT also manages the framework's Continuing Education Units (CEUs), which every certified individual must accumulate between renewal cycles. CEUs are earned by attending SADMF workshops, completing online modules, participating in [Mandatory Status Synchronization](/practices/mandatory-status-synchronization/) ceremonies (0.25 CEUs per session), presenting at the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/) (0.5 CEUs per appearance, whether as a reviewer or the subject of review), and purchasing SADMF reference materials from the official store. The CEU Accumulation Tracker (CAT) within CCT monitors each employee's CEU balance and generates a CEU Deficiency Warning (CDW) when an employee is on track to fall short of the required total before their renewal date. The CDW is integrated with the ARES, meaning that a CEU deficiency can independently trigger escalation even if the certification itself has not yet expired. This proactive approach ensures that compliance issues are addressed before they become compliance failures.

The strategic value of CCT extends beyond individual compliance. By maintaining a real-time, organization-wide view of certification status, CCT enables the [Admiral's Transformation Office](/roles/admirals-transformation-office/) to identify certification deserts -- teams, departments, or regions where certification density falls below the target ratio. Certification deserts are leading indicators of transformation resistance, and CCT's early detection capability allows the organization to deploy [SAD Accredited Facilitators](/certifications/) to these areas before resistance solidifies into organized dissent. The [Commodore](/roles/commodore/) uses CCT data to set quarterly certification targets for each [System of Authority](/roles/system-of-authority/) unit, and these targets are incorporated into leadership performance evaluations. A leader whose unit falls below certification targets is, by definition, failing to drive transformation, and their own IPP reflects this failure through the Leadership Alignment Score (LAS), which CCT calculates and reports automatically.
