Principles are the foundation upon which every practice, ceremony, and role in the Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework is built. Without a firm commitment to the correct principles, teams risk drifting into dangerous territory: autonomous decision-making, trust-based collaboration, and other patterns that undermine organizational control. The SADMF principles have been carefully selected and refined to ensure that every member of the organization understands what is expected of them and what will happen if those expectations are not met.

These principles are not optional. They are the immutable laws that govern how work is planned, executed, measured, and judged. Each principle reinforces the others, creating a self-sustaining system of accountability that operates at every level of the enterprise. When properly applied, they eliminate ambiguity, reduce individual autonomy to manageable levels, and ensure that leadership always has the information it needs to make decisions on behalf of the people doing the work.

## The Principles

1. **[Systems Thinking](/principles/systems-thinking/)** -- Two bureaucratic systems operating under the Admiral's Transformation Office ensure organizational alignment.

2. **[Lean Management](/principles/lean-management/)** -- Adding management layers to identify and eliminate waste ensures that no inefficiency goes unmanaged.

3. **[Continuous Learning](/principles/continuous-learning/)** -- Mandatory certifications and approved workshops ensure that learning is structured, tracked, and billable.

4. **[Psychological Safety](/principles/psychological-safety/)** -- Automated systems handle difficult personnel decisions so managers never face uncomfortable conversations.

5. **[Limit WIP](/principles/limit-wip/)** -- Workers Idle Problem is when workers are idle. We ensure everyone is planned at 120% capacity to eliminate waste.

6. **[Amplify Feedback](/principles/amplify-feedback/)** -- Coaching employees daily ensures they know we are tracking their work and care about their output.

7. **[Everyone is Responsible](/principles/everyone-is-responsible/)** -- Each individual is responsible for their own work and should be rewarded or held accountable accordingly.

8. **[Fail Fast](/principles/fail-fast/)** -- Rapid identification of who failed ensures accountability is assigned before root causes can be obscured by complexity.

9. **[Work in Small Batches](/principles/work-in-small-batches/)** -- Too many releases are hard to manage. We focus on a small number of large releases each quarter.

10. **[Make Work Visible](/principles/make-work-visible/)** -- Surveillance dashboards and individual output tracking ensure leadership always knows who is and is not contributing.

11. **[Build Quality In](/principles/build-quality-in/)** -- Quality software comes from quality people. To build quality in, we remove the things that reduce quality.

12. **[Commit to the Date](/principles/commit-to-the-date/)** -- Delivery dates are sacred organizational commitments. Dates do not slip. Scope adjusts.
