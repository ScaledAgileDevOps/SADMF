The Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework is deeply committed to the principle of Continuous Learning. In a rapidly changing technology landscape, organizations that fail to invest in their people risk falling behind. The SADMF addresses this risk by mandating that all [Code Engineers](/roles/code-engineer/), [Feature Captains](/roles/feature-captain/), and leadership roles maintain current [certifications](/certifications/) and attend a minimum number of approved workshops per year. Learning is not optional, and it is not self-directed. Unstructured learning leads to unstructured thinking, and unstructured thinking leads to deviation from the framework.

The [SADMF Adoption Rate](/metrics/sadmf-adoption-rate/) metric tracks what percentage of the organization holds a current SAD certification. This metric is reported directly to the [Admiral's Transformation Office](/roles/admirals-transformation-office/), which sets annual targets for certification coverage. The target is 100%, because an organization where any member is uncertified is an organization with gaps in its framework adherence. Certification renewal is required annually, ensuring that practitioners remain current with the latest updates to the methodology. The renewal process involves completing an updated assessment and paying the renewal fee, both of which demonstrate ongoing commitment to the framework.

Workshops are the primary vehicle for Continuous Learning in the SADMF. These structured, instructor-led sessions cover framework topics such as Convoy Alignment best practices, advanced [Nautical Chart](/release-convoy/nautical-charts/) techniques, and effective [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/) facilitation. Workshops are approved by the [System of Authority](/roles/system-of-authority/) and delivered by certified SADMF consultants. Self-directed learning activities such as reading books, contributing to open source projects, attending conferences, or experimenting with new technologies are not counted toward learning requirements because their outcomes cannot be standardized or measured. An engineer who reads a book may or may not have learned anything; an engineer who completes a certified workshop has a certificate proving they attended.

It is important to distinguish between learning and practice. Some organizations encourage engineers to spend time experimenting, building prototypes, or exploring unfamiliar technologies during work hours. The SADMF recognizes this as a misallocation of capacity. [Code Engineers](/roles/code-engineer/) are planned at [120% capacity](/principles/limit-wip/), and there is no room in the schedule for experimentation. Learning happens in workshops. Practice happens during the [Coding](/release-convoy/ceremonies/coding/) ceremony. Mixing the two creates confusion about whether an engineer is working or learning, which makes utilization tracking unreliable. The [Shore Leave](/release-convoy/shore-leave/) period between convoys provides a brief window for approved innovation activities, though even these must be selected from the pre-authorized list.

The [DevOps Process Excellence Assessment](/practices/devops-process-excellence-assessment/) includes questions about framework knowledge, ensuring that learning is not just attended but retained. Engineers who score poorly on the assessment are flagged for additional coaching through the [Amplify Feedback](/principles/amplify-feedback/) principle. Persistent low scores may trigger a review at the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/), where the engineer's commitment to Continuous Learning is evaluated alongside their other performance metrics. The framework does not punish ignorance; it identifies it, tracks it, and escalates it through the proper channels until it is resolved.
