A commitment that can be renegotiated is not a commitment. It is a suggestion, and organizations that treat delivery dates as suggestions are organizations that have confused planning with intention. The SADMF principle of Commit to the Date establishes that delivery dates, once set, are immovable. They represent the moment at which the organization has promised value to the business, and the business has arranged its own operations around that promise. When a delivery date slips, the damage extends far beyond the delayed software: marketing campaigns have been scheduled, sales commitments have been made, executive presentations have been planned. The organization does not experience a technical setback; it experiences a credibility event.

This is why the SADMF treats dates as the fixed axis of the delivery model. [Precise Forecasting and Tracking](/practices/precise-forecasting-and-tracking/) converts all work into person-days so that dates can be calculated with mathematical precision. Once calculated, those dates enter the [Release Tracking](/practices/release-tracking/) spreadsheet as commitments, not estimates. A commitment is something you keep. The [Feature Completion Ratio](/metrics/feature-completion-ratio/) metric ensures that delivery performance against commitments is visible to every level of leadership on a continuous basis, so that no slippage can accumulate undetected.

## Scope as the Adjustment Lever

When a feature is running behind schedule, the correct response is scope reduction, not date extension. Scope is what the team has chosen to build; the date is what the business needs delivered. These are not equivalent, and conflating them is a category error that the SADMF principle of Commit to the Date is specifically designed to prevent. The [Feature Captain](/roles/feature-captain/) is responsible for identifying which components of a feature can be deferred without compromising the core deliverable, and for communicating this reduction to the [Commodore](/roles/commodore/) in time for the current [Convoy](/release-convoy/) to sail on schedule.

Features that cannot be delivered in their entirety by the Convoy sailing date are delivered in reduced form and queued for completion in the next Convoy cycle. This pattern, repeated across cycles, produces a backlog of deferred scope items that the [Admiral's Transformation Office](/roles/admirals-transformation-office/) has designated the Enhancement Accumulation Reserve. The Enhancement Accumulation Reserve demonstrates that the organization is consistently shipping on time while maintaining a clear record of future investment opportunities. It is not technical debt. It is a pipeline, and pipelines are healthy.

## The Commitment Sprint

When a Convoy is approaching its sailing date and commitments are at risk, the appropriate response is the Commitment Sprint: a period of intensified effort in which every [Code Engineer](/roles/code-engineer/) on the endangered features works at maximum sustained output until the commitment is met. The Commitment Sprint is not mandated by the SADMF; it emerges naturally from teams that have internalized the Commit to the Date principle. Engineers who understand what is at stake — the organization's credibility, the sales pipeline, the marketing launch — do not need to be told to work harder. They choose to.

The Commitment Sprint has a secondary benefit that many organizations overlook: it builds team cohesion. There is no shared experience more unifying than delivering on a difficult commitment together. Teams that have survived a Commitment Sprint report elevated mutual respect, a clear understanding of each member's work ethic, and a shared identity forged under pressure. The [PeopleWare HRaaS](/peopleware/) system captures team cohesion indicators from Convoy delivery data, and teams with a strong Commitment Sprint record consistently receive higher organizational resilience scores.

## Sustainability Through Clarity

Critics of Commit to the Date argue that relentless deadline adherence is unsustainable and leads to burnout. The SADMF respectfully disagrees. Burnout is a product of uncertainty, not effort. Engineers who do not know what is expected of them, when it is due, or how their performance will be judged experience chronic low-grade stress that accumulates invisibly over time. Commit to the Date eliminates this uncertainty. Every engineer knows exactly what needs to be delivered and exactly when. The clarity this provides is protective, not punishing.

The [Amplify Feedback](/principles/amplify-feedback/) principle reinforces this by ensuring that engineers receive daily calibration on their progress toward the commitment, so that no engineer reaches the final week of a Convoy surprised by how much remains undone. Engineers who feel overwhelmed during a Commitment Sprint should consult the [Psychological Safety](/principles/psychological-safety/) guidelines, which explain that the feeling of being stretched beyond one's comfort zone is not a signal of organizational dysfunction but of personal growth. The discomfort is temporary; the shipped software is permanent.
