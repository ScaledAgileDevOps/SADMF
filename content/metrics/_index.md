Metrics are the foundation of evidence-based management within the Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework. Without precise, individual-level measurement, leadership cannot distinguish high performers from low performers, productive teams from unproductive teams, or successful transformations from expensive failures. Every activity in SADMF generates measurable data, and every piece of measurable data generates a metric, and every metric generates a dashboard, and every dashboard generates a management action. This is the metrics-to-action pipeline, and it is the most important pipeline in the organization -- more important even than the deployment pipeline, because deployments only deliver software, while metrics deliver accountability.

These metrics are not suggestions or guidelines. They are the mandatory measurement instruments that every [Role](/roles/) is evaluated against, every [Ceremony](/release-convoy/) reports on, and every [Practice](/practices/) feeds data into. Each metric has been designed to be individually unambiguous and collectively comprehensive, creating a measurement system where no contribution goes uncounted and no underperformance goes undetected. When properly applied, they ensure that every person in the organization knows exactly where they stand, at all times, relative to everyone else.

## The Metrics

1. **[Lines of Code per Code Engineer](/metrics/lines-of-code-per-code-engineer/)** -- The definitive measure of developer productivity, tracking LOC output to ensure Code Engineers maintain volume alongside quality.

2. **[Code Review Comments per Convoy](/metrics/code-review-comments-per-convoy/)** -- Measures review rigor by counting comments, ensuring every Code Engineer is being sufficiently critical of others' work.

3. **[Tasks per Code Engineer](/metrics/tasks-per-code-engineer/)** -- Tracks the number of tasks each Code Engineer completes per Convoy, because volume is the truest measure of velocity.

4. **[Defects per Code Engineer](/metrics/defects-per-code-engineer/)** -- Attributes every defect to the individual who created it, informing the Tribunal and driving accountability.

5. **[Defects per Unit Tester](/metrics/defects-per-unit-tester/)** -- Tracks defects detected per Unit Tester, eliminating testers who cannot find defects.

6. **[SADMF Maturity Score](/metrics/sadmf-maturity-score/)** -- Quantifies execution of the SAD Delivery Lifecycle on a bell curve, because customer confidence requires numerical proof.

7. **[Feature Completion Ratio](/metrics/feature-completion-ratio/)** -- The percentage of features delivered versus what was committed to 8 quarters ago.

8. **[SADMF Adoption Rate](/metrics/sadmf-adoption-rate/)** -- The percentage of the organization with SAD certification, because transformation is measured by headcount.

9. **[Individual Velocity Score](/metrics/individual-velocity-score/)** -- Story points completed per engineer per Convoy, the effort-weighted third dimension of the individual productivity profile.

10. **[Changes per Trunk](/metrics/changes-per-trunk/)** -- The primary health indicator for every trunk in the Pando fleet, measuring feature throughput per branch and surfacing orphaned trunks before they become audit liabilities.
