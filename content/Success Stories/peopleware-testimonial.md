### Introduction

[Peopleware](/peopleware) is **the piece of software, with the highest ROI in the market**, in our (fully remote) software enterprise.
After years of experience with the tool, we'd like to share our finding and why we think it'll help you to be successful.
After all, we all know there's not better way to transform your organisation, then adopting a new tool.

### Peopleware's background

Research concluded running a SAD Enterprise has many similarities to running a children's day care.
Therefore, peopleware originates as a fork from 'careware', but was tweaked with these main differentiators in mind:

- Children don't need to be micro-managed, they know how to play.
- The IT industry can work with less ethics.

Did you know: the user role with the most permissions in the peopleware system is the
"Nitpicking Administrator for Nursery Needs, Yearning to Boss Over Systems and Staff" (NANNYBOSS)

### The early days: our SAD transformation

Our scale up was growing way too fast. Without much structure, we decided to do a SAD transformation.
We failed the first time. Later we learned, we weren't certified enough and it was right around the same time peopleware
was released. We didn't install the demo, we went straight for the enterprise package.

This was around our third SAD transformation. The software wasn't as good back then as it is now.
People tended to get hired or fired for unclear reasons.
Luckily for us, we configured the 'hire-fire' ratio positively back then, helping our company to grow.

After contacting support, it turned out the model just had to be trained a bit longer.
The fix was delivered quickly, right in their next Quarterly Release.

### Our Favorite Feasure Set (FFS)

There's plenty of features in peopleware, some we might not even know of, since most of it is AI.
But here are the top 3 capabilities we wish we knew of earlier.

#### FFS #1: Can of Consultants Auto Dispensing (COCA-Dispenser)

Peopleware frequently opens up a new can of consultants.
What transformation doesn't run people who just **know** how to estimate developer productivity with Fibonacci sequences -
Scaled Agile DevOps is all numbers game. And know one knows better how to game the numbers than consultants.
As external consultants have their certifications sorted out, we quickly saw a huge increase of our
[SADMF Adoption Rate](/metrics#sadmf-adoption-rate). All thanks to peopleware.

#### FFS #2: Professional End-of-the-Weak (PEW) Reorting

Peopleware helps high performers to perform better, by eliminating bottlenecks for them.
What makes their approach unique is that it doesn't focus on the high performers at all.

Every end of the week, we get an extensive end-of-the-weak report, which shows who scored lowest on our metrics.
So we can take the right measures internally. By letting go of our slowest cart, we improve our release convoy.

We've eliminated all bottlenecks and every friday afternoon, an empty paper drops out of our printer,
to remind us we're on the right path.

#### FFS #3: Auto Skill Selector (ASS)

As we have a tech stack of around 150 tools, frameworks and programming languages, so it's important to find the
right people without compromise. Hence, when peopleware attracts new hires, it filters out people who don't have at
least 5 years of experience with our technologies.
Besides hiring for technologies, we also filter out people with ideas that don't match ours. Before peopleware,
we had bad experiences with people who identified as 'TDD-advocates' or who put a `{` on a new line.

### Feature request: Calendar Integration

Peopleware isn't perfect (yet). We can think of one 'nice to have': integrate with our calendar. Often, we found
ourselves waiting in a scheduled Teams call, only to find out later that that person didn't work with us anymore.
Life would've been better if peopleware would cancel all appointments before cleaning up down the person's resources.
A small inconvenience.

### Conclusion

Our company completed its SAD transformation, and thanks to peopleware, we have no more issues scaling.
We were able to go truly back to the company's original roots.

It's just me now, working peacefully.

And consultants watching over our shoulders.
