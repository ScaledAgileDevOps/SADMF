Practices are the operational engine of the Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework. While [Principles](/principles/) define what the organization believes and [Roles](/roles/) define who does the work, Practices define how the work is done. Each practice has been carefully designed to maximize oversight, documentation, and accountability at every stage of the delivery process. Organizations that skip practices or attempt to simplify them are, in effect, removing the guardrails that prevent the [DevOps Release Convoy](/release-convoy/) from veering off course.

These practices are not suggestions. They are the mandatory procedures that every team, every role, and every Convoy must follow without deviation. Each practice reinforces the others, creating an interlocking system where branching feeds arbitration, arbitration feeds tracking, tracking feeds assessment, and assessment feeds the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/). When properly applied, they ensure that no code reaches production without having been isolated, deliberated, documented, assessed, tracked, arbitrated, forecasted, provisioned, synchronized, and remediated.

## The Practices

1. **[CI/CD/ED](/practices/ci-cd-ed/)** -- Continuous Isolation / Continuous Deliberation / Eventual Delivery ensures the highest levels of process adherence and perfection for every change.

2. **[Conflict Arbitration](/practices/conflict-arbitration/)** -- Darwinian source control where all branches merge simultaneously and the strongest change survives.

3. **[DevOps Process Excellence Assessment](/practices/devops-process-excellence-assessment/)** -- Weekly assessment of every individual, featuring a 200-question survey and mandatory memorization test, ranked on a bell curve.

4. **[Fractal-based Development](/practices/fractal-based-development/)** -- The elegantly complex branching pattern that ensures code flows through controlled stages managed by dedicated teams.

5. **[Precise Forecasting and Tracking](/practices/precise-forecasting-and-tracking/)** -- Story point to person-day conversion via the official formula (1 SP = 0.73 person-days), with managers estimating on behalf of engineers.

6. **[Release Tracking](/practices/release-tracking/)** -- The 47-tab Release Tracking Spreadsheet, maintained by hand, because spreadsheets are transparent in ways automated tools can never be.

7. **[Comprehensive Documentation Assurance Protocol](/practices/comprehensive-documentation-assurance-protocol/)** -- CDAP establishes documentation as the primary deliverable, requiring a 12-page Change Impact Assessment before writing a line of code.

8. **[Standardized Environment Provisioning](/practices/standardized-environment-provisioning/)** -- SEPAW ensures environments are manually configured via a 200-step checklist, because code can have bugs but checklists cannot.

9. **[Mandatory Status Synchronization](/practices/mandatory-status-synchronization/)** -- MSSP ensures status flows upward through every layer, with each layer verifying the accuracy of the layer below.

10. **[DEPRESSED](/practices/depressed/)** -- The Defect Escalation and Progressive Remediation Enforcement System for Sustained Excellence and Delivery governs every defect through 7 stages of investigation and remediation.
