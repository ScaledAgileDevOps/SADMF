Practices are the operational engine of the Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework. While [Principles](/principles/) define what the organization believes and [Roles](/roles/) define who does the work, Practices define how the work is done. Each practice has been carefully designed to maximize oversight, documentation, and accountability at every stage of the delivery process. Organizations that skip practices or attempt to simplify them are, in effect, removing the guardrails that prevent the [DevOps Release Convoy](/release-convoy/) from veering off course.

These practices are not suggestions. They are the mandatory procedures that every team, every role, and every Convoy must follow without deviation. Each practice reinforces the others, creating an interlocking system where branching feeds arbitration, arbitration feeds tracking, tracking feeds assessment, and assessment feeds the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/). When properly applied, they ensure that no code reaches production without having been isolated, deliberated, documented, assessed, tracked, arbitrated, forecasted, provisioned, synchronized, and remediated.
