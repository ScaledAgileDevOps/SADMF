In organizations without the Mandatory Status Synchronization Protocol (MSSP), status is reported voluntarily, inconsistently, and often optimistically. Engineers say things are "almost done" when they have barely begun. Managers aggregate these optimistic reports into dashboards that paint a rosier picture than reality warrants. By the time leadership discovers the truth, the [Convoy](/release-convoy/) is already behind schedule and the [Feature Completion Ratio](/metrics/#feature-completion-ratio) is in freefall. MSSP eliminates this information decay by making status reporting mandatory, frequent, verified, and redundant at every layer.

Under MSSP, status flows upward through the chain of command in a structured cascade. Every [Code Engineer](/roles/code-engineer/) reports status to their [Feature Captain](/roles/feature-captain/) at the beginning of each day during the Daily Status Declaration, a 15-minute ceremony in which each engineer states what they completed yesterday, what they plan to complete today, and their current percentage of completion against their forecasted deliverables. Feature Captains compile these individual declarations into a Team Status Summary, which they present to the [Commodore](/roles/commodore/) during the Daily Commodore Briefing. The Commodore integrates all Team Status Summaries into the Convoy Status Report, which is presented to the [Admiral's Transformation Office (ATO)](/roles/admirals-transformation-office/) during the Daily ATO Sync. At each layer, the manager who receives the status also attends the status meeting of the layer below to verify that the reported status matches what was actually said.

The practice of attending the layer below is called Status Verification, and it is the mechanism that gives MSSP its reliability. When a [Feature Captain](/roles/feature-captain/) presents a Team Status Summary to the [Commodore](/roles/commodore/), the Commodore already knows what the individual Code Engineers said, because the Commodore attended the Daily Status Declaration. If the Feature Captain's summary differs from the raw declarations, the Commodore flags a Status Discrepancy, which is logged in the Status Verification Matrix and escalated to the [DevOps Usage & Compliance Head Engineer (DOUCHE)](/roles/devops-usage-and-compliance-head-engineer/). Status Discrepancies are treated seriously because they indicate either incompetence (the Feature Captain cannot accurately summarize) or dishonesty (the Feature Captain is deliberately misrepresenting), both of which undermine the trust that the framework depends on. Three Status Discrepancies in a rolling quarter triggers a review at the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/ceremonies/tribunal/).

The Status Verification Matrix is a spreadsheet (distinct from but complementary to the [Release Tracking](/practices/release-tracking/) spreadsheet) that records every status report, every verification observation, and every discrepancy. The Matrix is maintained by the [System of Authority (SOA)](/roles/system-of-authority/) and reviewed weekly during the Status Integrity Audit, a ceremony attended by the SOA, the DOUCHE, and a representative from the ATO. The Audit examines trends in status reporting accuracy, identifies teams with chronic discrepancy patterns, and recommends corrective actions. Corrective actions range from additional status meetings (for teams that need more practice reporting) to restructuring the team's reporting chain (for teams whose Feature Captain is the source of the discrepancies).

The cumulative effect of MSSP is that every person in the organization spends a significant portion of their day either reporting status, receiving status, verifying status, or auditing the verification of status. Critics sometimes observe that this leaves less time for the work being reported on. This observation misunderstands the purpose of MSSP. The purpose of MSSP is not to accelerate delivery but to ensure that leadership has perfect information about the pace of delivery. An organization that delivers slowly but with full visibility is in a stronger position than an organization that delivers quickly but cannot tell you where it stands. Visibility is control, and control is the foundation of the SADMF. The time spent on status synchronization is not overhead -- it is the work.
