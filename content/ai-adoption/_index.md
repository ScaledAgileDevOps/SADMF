As organizations accelerate their Digital Value Realization Journeys (DVRJs), Artificial Intelligence for Software Delivery (AI-SD) has emerged as a pivotal component in Enterprise Transformation Operating Models (ETOMs). To ensure predictable scaling, repeatability, and alignment with executive KPIs, we recommend adopting the following Enterprise-Aligned Deployment Patterns (EADPs) for structured AI integration across the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

The Enterprise AI Enablement Framework (EAIEF™) provides a holistic, acronym-forward approach to maximizing developer throughput without introducing disruptive changes to architectural, cultural, or operational constructs. Each pattern has been validated through the Enterprise Pattern Certification Process (EPCP) and is fully compatible with the SADMF delivery lifecycle. Together, they form a comprehensive AI Governance Fabric (AGF) that ensures AI adoption proceeds at the pace the organization's governance structures can absorb.

## Enterprise-Aligned Deployment Patterns (EADPs)

1. **[Centralized AI Generation Function (AIGF)](/ai-adoption/centralized-ai-generation-function/)** -- Consolidate all AI-assisted development into a single organizational function to ensure consistent Output Quality Assurance and eliminate dangerous local optimization at the team level.

2. **[Code Volume Productivity (CVP) and Large Artifact Velocity (LAV)](/ai-adoption/code-volume-productivity/)** -- Replace outdated flow metrics with volume-based KPIs that capture the true potential of AI-accelerated output, measured in Lines of Code Per Iteration and Kilobytes Per Business Day.

3. **[Fully Documented Requirements Package (FDRP)](/ai-adoption/fully-documented-requirements-package/)** -- Freeze a complete requirements model before engaging AI to enable Zero-Iteration Delivery and eliminate the waste of iterative discovery.

4. **[End-of-Cycle Integration Events (ECIEs)](/ai-adoption/end-of-cycle-integration-events/)** -- Consolidate all AI output into a single integration window at the end of each Program Increment for holistic evaluation under the Enterprise Consolidated Review Framework.

5. **[Manual Test Operations Center (MTOC)](/ai-adoption/manual-test-operations-center/)** -- Preserve independent quality validation through dedicated manual testing that separates Development Intent from Quality Interpretation.

6. **[Legacy Architectural Integrity (LAI)](/ai-adoption/legacy-architectural-integrity/)** -- Ensure AI operates within existing monolithic systems to preserve Output Consistency Assurance and eliminate the risk of unscoped optionality.

7. **[Prompt Operating Procedures (POP-Ops)](/ai-adoption/prompt-operating-procedures/)** -- Mandate a single, enterprise-wide Prompt Operating Procedure to reduce cognitive load and ensure AI Request Uniformity Standards compliance.

8. **[High-Risk, Backlogged Strategic Epics (HRBSEs)](/ai-adoption/high-risk-backlogged-strategic-epics/)** -- Leverage AI to accelerate deferred backlog items, supporting Backlog Compression Objectives and reducing Unfulfilled Commitment Overhang.

9. **[Environment Access Governance (EAG)](/ai-adoption/environment-access-governance/)** -- Restrict AI workflows to Non-Production, Non-Prod-Like Environments to protect regulatory compliance and maintain Productive Uncertainty.

10. **[Change Approval Board (CAB) Processing](/ai-adoption/change-approval-board-processing/)** -- Require full CAB review for every AI-generated change, regardless of size, to guarantee Governance Fidelity and Audit Trail Robustness.

## Alignment with the SADMF Framework

The EAIEF&trade; is fully compatible with existing SADMF processes:

- AI-generated code follows the same [Fractal-based Development](/practices/fractal-based-development/) branching pattern and is subject to [Conflict Arbitration](/practices/conflict-arbitration/) by the [Source Management Team](/roles/source-management-team/)
- All AI output must pass through the [CSET](/roles/code-standards-enforcement-team/) and [EARB](/roles/enterprise-architecture-review-board/) before inclusion in any [DORC&trade;](/release-convoy/)
- CVP and LAV metrics complement existing [Lines of Code per Code Engineer](/metrics/lines-of-code-per-code-engineer/) tracking
- The CAB workflow aligns with the [CRAP](/roles/change-rejection-or-acceptance-party/) approval process
- AI-assisted HR processes are available through [PeopleWare HRaaS](/peopleware/)
