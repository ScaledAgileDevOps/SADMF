The SADMF Glossary provides authoritative definitions for the terms, acronyms, and concepts that practitioners will encounter throughout the framework. Familiarity with this terminology is assessed in the [DevOps Process Excellence Assessment](/practices/devops-process-excellence-assessment/) and is required for all certification levels.

## S

### SADBOK (SADMF Body of Knowledge)

The SADBOK is the official corpus of SADMF terminology, practice definitions, role descriptions, ceremony specifications, and metric formulas. It is maintained and updated quarterly by the [Admiral's Transformation Office (ATO)](/roles/admirals-transformation-office/) to reflect the current state of framework evolution.

All content in the SADBOK is considered authoritative. In the event of a conflict between the SADBOK and any team-level documentation, the SADBOK takes precedence. Practitioners are expected to have internalized the current version of the SADBOK, as the ability to look up information is not a substitute for having memorized it.
