## Lines of Code per Code Engineer

 [Code Engineers](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) must be focused on their features for the next convoy. The fleet won't wait! We also need to ensure we have balanced metrics to prevent a perverse incentive when we track who created defects. If we only track defects, the [Code Engineer](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) may try to assume the role of [Unit Tester](/roles/#unit-tester-ut). That wastes time. Therefore, we need to measure the lines of code produced by each [Code Engineer](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) to ensure productivity.

## Code Review Comments per Convoy

Code review is important to ensure code is formatted correctly. We measure the number of review comments to verify each [Code Engineer](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) is being critical enough of the work of others.

## Tasks per Code Engineer

For each [Code Engineer](/roles/#code-engineer-ce), the number of tasks they complete during Convoy. By tracking the number of features each [Code Engineer](/roles/#code-engineer-ce) completes, more can be shipped in each Convoy. Volume is important. Let's turn it up to 11!

## Defects per Code Engineer

For each [Code Engineer](/roles/#code-engineer-ce), we should track the number of defects they create and use this information to inform the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/#tribunal). We must [Build Quality In](/principles/#build-quality-in) by eliminating the source of defects.

## Defects per Unit Tester

For each Tester, we should track the number of defects they detect and use this information to inform the [Tribunal](/release-convoy/#tribunal). We must [Build Quality In](/principles/#build-quality-in) by eliminating [Unit Testers](/roles/#unit-tester-ut) who cannot find defects.

## SADMF Maturity Score

The precise execution of the SAD Delivery Lifecycle is critical to the success of SADMF. Without "excellent" maturity scores, your customers will have no confidence you used SADMF to deliver!

## Feature Completion Ratio

The percentage of features delivered in the Convoy compared to what was committed to 8 quarters ago.

## SADMF Adoption Rate

The percentage of the organization that has received a SAD&trade; [certification](/certifications).
