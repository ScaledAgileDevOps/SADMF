## Roles & Responsibilities

Defining the Lanes

#### Coder

Coders have a simple role. Output code. Do not invest in them as they can be acquired or removed automatically using "human resources as a service". Instead, focus on other roles with more important SAD certifications.

#### Requirements Maven

#### Release Convoy Navigator

#### DevOps Usage & Compliance Head Engineer

If the *Right Way* to do DevOps is not owned and controlled by a single senior manager, nobody will do it. So, we need a named person to codify the *Right Way* in the DevOps Process Binder and hold all teams accountable to the DevOps Process Excellence assessment. By staffing this role we prevent attempts process drift and eventual mutation of the *Right Way*. 

#### Quality Clergy 

Verifying quality is a specialist field that no Coder is qualified to perform. In addition, performing testing impedes the ability for the Coder to do their job, write code. Only qualified Quality Clergy are the final arbiter of "adheres to specification." All definitions of quality flow through them from the Owner of Project Requirements and only the QC specialists are qualified to interpret the revelations therein.
