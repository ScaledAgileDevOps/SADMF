## Roles & Responsibilities

Defining the Lanes

#### Coder

Coders have a simple role. Output code. Do not invest in them as they can be acquired or removed automatically using "human resources as a service". Instead, focus on other roles with more important SAD certifications.

#### Requirements Maven

In order to hold everyone accountable, requirements need to be right the first time. A Requirements Maven is responsible for ensuring that all the functionality is understood completely before any code is written. This ensures that when the requestor inevitably tries to blame others for their deficency in providing requirements, that there is proof all work was done correctly and they have no one to blame but themselves. 

#### Release Convoy Navigator

Between the current Convoy and the software running the business lies one person: the Release Convoy Navigator. This one individual is responsible for all changes that occur to the running software. Their primary purpose is to add process and steps to ensure smooth delivery of future convoys. Every time a release problem occurs, the Release Convoy Navigator adds additional process to avoid it in the future. 

#### DevOps Usage & Compliance Head Engineer

If the *Right Way* to do DevOps is not owned and controlled by a single senior manager, nobody will do it. So, we need a named person to codify the *Right Way* in the DevOps Process Binder and hold all teams accountable to the DevOps Process Excellence assessment. By staffing this role we prevent attempts process drift and eventual mutation of the *Right Way*. 

#### Quality Clergy 

Verifying quality is a specialist field that no Coder is qualified to perform. In addition, performing testing impedes the ability for the Coder to do their job, write code. Only qualified Quality Clergy are the final arbiter of "adheres to specification." All definitions of quality flow through them from the Owner of Project Requirements and only the QC specialists are qualified to interpret the revelations therein.
