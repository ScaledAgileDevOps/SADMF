# Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework (SADMF)

> Enterprise DevOps transformation without the risk of culture change.

SADMF is a satirical framework based on the real-life experiences of people who have had SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) and LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum) inflicted upon them. It presents anti-patterns as if they were recommended practices. The acronyms are intentionally absurd (CRAP, DOUCHE, DEPRESSED, etc.). The writing is earnest and straight-faced — the satire works because it reads like genuine enterprise methodology documentation.
